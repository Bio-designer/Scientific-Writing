Coherence –the quality of being logically and aesthetically consistent –is the desired result.

You have already undertaken the initial steps in the process –planning, gathering, and organizing information, then writing a first draft and setting it aside long enough to view it with a fresh eye. [omg, one year past…]

Our first thoughts are not necessarily the best and they may not be arranged in the most effective order.

Revising by the Process Approach entails a series of nested steps, each concentrating on successively finer points. The first and broadest step concentrates on the document’s structure and basic style. It includes matters such as organization, logic, accuracy, brevity, and clarity.

Command the program to insert a date and/or time into the header or footer, as well. These ﬁelds also are particularly useful when more than one person is working on a document, or when a document goes through several revisions. Dates and times can either be frozen, or can reﬂect the current date and time each time a document is opened or printed.

In spoken language, phrases and ideas are often repeated, in order to give the listener time to absorb them, and to provide clues to meaning. Inﬂection and timing – including the use of silence – give a listener additional clues to the message. In written language, a reader can, if necessary, reread a passage but the inﬂection and timing clues are absent. Meaning depends entirely on word choice.

A scientiﬁc article should hold the attention of its readers by the importance of its content, not by its literary presentation.

What it does mean is that verbose words and phrases should not be included in a vain attempt to impress the reader with the writer’s intellect and scientiﬁc status. Sentence structure should not have to be puzzled over. Paragraphs should not ramble on and on.

Clarity includes what some call “grace of expression.” People have grace when they go beyond politeness and act with an eye to the needs and comfort of others.

“Good prose is like a window pane,” wrote George Orwell, the English essayist – it is transparent in the sense that it puts no visible obstacle between the reader and the message.

Although the content of a document is more likely to determine whether it is accepted for publication than is its prose style, gracefully written text gives readers a sense that the author has mastered his or her subject. The ﬁrst of those readers will be the editor and the document reviewers
